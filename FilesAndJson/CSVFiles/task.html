<p>In this task you will have to complete two classes:
<ol>
    <li>The <code>Task</code> class</li>
    <li>The <code>Database</code> class.</li>
</ol></p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>
    If you look at the project, at the bottom there is a
    folder named <code>resources</code>. In this folder
    you will see a file called <code>iris.data</code>.
    This is a text file. Double click on it and look at its
    contents.
</p>
<p><code>iris.data</code> is what is known as a comma separated values
    file (or CSV file). That is, if you think of the file as
    a grid, each line is a row and commas delimit columns.</p>
<p>For example, the first three lines of the file are:<br>

    <code>
        s-length,s-width,p-length,p-width,species<br/>
        5.1,3.5,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa<br/>
        4.9,3.0,1.4,0.2,Iris-setosa<br/>
    </code><br>
    Which is equivalent to:<br/>
<table border="1">
    <tr>
        <td>s-length</td><td>s-width</td><td>p-length</td><td>p-width</td><td>species</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5.1</td><td>3.5</td><td>1.4</td><td>0.2</td><td>Iris-setosa</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4.9</td><td>3.0</td><td>1.4</td><td>0.2</td><td>Iris-setosa</td>
    </tr>
</table>

</p>

<p>The first line of <code>iris.data</code> contains the
    headers of the columns.</p>
<p>
    The following lines contain the actual data.
</p>
<h3>Classes (Your job)</h3>
<ol>
    <li>The purpose of the <code>Database</code> class is to stores the contents
        of a CSV file in several variables and to facilitate access to
        those contents. In the <code>Database</code> class you will have to complete
        two methdos
        <ul>
            <li>the Constructor, that takes in the contents of a CSV file as a String: In here
                you should put code to initialize all of the member variables of the class:
                <ol>
                    <li><code>colNames</code>: is an array with the column names (from the first row)</li>
                    <li><code>numRows</code>: is the total number of data rows (not counting the first line with the column names)</li>
                    <li><code>data</code>: is a 2D array that contains the data as a grid of <code>String</code> objects.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The <code>getValue</code> method takes a column name and a row number and retrieves the corresponding element.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Task class has one method to compete:
        <code>readCSV</code>.
        <ul>
            <li>This method takes in a file name as parameter and returns a <code>Database</code> object</li>
            <li>You have to complete the bits and pieces to take the file name and read the
                contents of the file into the <code>String contents</code>.
                Then use <code>contents</code> to initialize a <code>Database</code>
                object and return it.</li>
            <li>
                A special note on reading <code>byte[]</code>s: You can convert a <code>byte[]</code> to a <code>String</code>
                with a special constructor for the <code>String</code> class. This
                constructor takes in the <code>byte[]</code>, the starting position of that array, and the number of elements to
                read from it. Check the Javadocs for more information.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

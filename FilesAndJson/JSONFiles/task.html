<h3>Another Database</h3>
<p>The task for this module is to complete another
    two classes named <code>Database</code> and <code>Task</code>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you will have a <code>Database</code> of restaurants
    with minimal functionality.</p>
<h3>Specific Tasks</h3>
<ul>
    <li><code>Task</code> has two methods besides <code>main</code>.
        <ul><li><code>readFile</code>: You should complete this method first.
            It is similar to the readFile method in the CSVFiles task, but it uses
            a <code>BufferedReader</code>. Your job is to complete it and
            return a <code>String</code> with the contents of the file.<li>
            <li><code>readJson</code>: Code this method second, as you can use the
                previous method for help. This method takes a filename (<code>String</code>) and
                reads the file as a <code>String</code> and creates a JSON
                document from it. Then, returns it.</li>
            <div class="hint">Check the last slide from io to find out how to
                create a JsonObject from a String.</div>
            <li><code>Database</code> has two methods and a constructor.
                <ul>
                    <li>The constructor should set a member variable. You pick
                        the name.</li>
                    <li><code>getRestaurant</code>. Given the name of a
                        restaurant, this method returns the JSON object corresponding
                        to that restaurant.</li>
                    <li><code>getAverageReviews</code>: This method should lookup
                        the reviews for a given restaurant and obtain the average.
                        To obtain the total size of a <code>JsonArray</code> you can
                        use the <code>size()</code> method.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Don't forget to run the "check" until you get the task in the best shape you can</h4>

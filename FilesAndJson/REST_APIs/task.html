<h3>The Ultimate TV Show Database</h3>
<p>The task for this module to complete the class
    <code>TVShowsDatabase</code>. This class connects to
    a website (TVMaze.com) and allows you to query shows by name
    or query celebrities that appear in shows. The website returns its results as a list of JSON documents. It
    is an API.
<h3>Specific Tasks</h3>
<ul>
    <li><code>TVShowsDatabase</code> has
        five methods and a default constructor.
        <ul>
            <li>You have to create a <code>getURLSource</code> method that takes in a <code>URL</code>.
                Based on the URL given, the method queries the online site and brings the contents of it as a <code>String</code>.
                <strong>You have to watch the videos to get this. This is not in the slides</strong>. Lastly, because this is
            a string that contains a list of JSON documents, you need to make it
            look like a proper JSON document with a root element. That is, append
            <code>{'result':</code> at the beginning of the string and <code>}</code> at the
            end. This effectively creates a JSON string with the root element "result"
            and the value will be a list; the list returned by the website.</li>.
            <li><code>getShowsByName</code> receives a String and throws an Exception.
                Should assemble a url to query based on the API (this is done for you). With that URL, it
                should call the method you created above to get a JSON string with the contents of the
                URL. Then, you must convert this to a <code>JsonObject</code> and return it.</li>
            <li><code>getPeopleInShows</code> receives a String and throws an Exception.
                Should assemble a url to query based on the API (this is done for you). With that URL, it
                should call the method you created above to get a JSON string with the contents of the
                URL. Then, you must convert this to a <code>JsonObject</code> and return it.</li>
            <li><code>formatShowAsString</code>: This method takes in a <code>JsonObject</code> with shows and
                converts the documents into a <code>String</code>. The String must be formatted as described as in the examples below (you may need to scroll sideways
                to see the full table):

            <li><code>saveShows</code>: This method takes in a String like the one above and saves it to a file specified in <code>outfile</code>.
                It should save no more and no less than the <code>String</code> passed. In here you can try a few methods to see what works. When this
                is working, if you run <code>Task.java</code> you will see a file appear in the root directory of your project. You can then
                check that it is working all right.</li>
        </ul>
        Run <code>Task.java</code> to check that everything is compiling and working before running tests. Also, you can modify this
        class to test and debug your code.
        <h4>Don't forget to run the "check" until you get the task in the best shape you can</h4>

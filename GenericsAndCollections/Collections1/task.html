The task here is to code a <code>Card</code> class that represents
a playing card. Then code a <code>Deck</code> class that
can hold all the cards in a deck and can deal random cards.
We also want to be able to use the for-each loop with the
<code>Deck</code> class. For that we need to create an <code>Iterator</code>.
We will call it <code>DeckIterator</code>.
Lastly, you will have to complete a few methods in the <code>Task</code>
class.
<h3>Card</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The constructor takes a value and a suit that
        match the types of the member variables, and initializes them. </li>
 <li>The possible <code>values</code> are Ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King;
 and, for reference (you don't need this here) their corresponding values are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13.
     The possible values for <code>suit</code> are Hearts,Diamond,Clubs and Spades</li>
    <li>Code all getters and setters</li>
    <li>Override the <code>toString</code> method. Make
        it return the value of the card, the word "of" and the suit
        of the card. For example: "4 of Spades"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deck (first pass)</h3>
The <code>Deck</code> has two variables for you. One
is a <code>List</code> that can hold the cards; the
other is a <code>String[]</code> that may help you
initialize the cards in a deck.
<ul>
    <li>The constructor should create all the
        cards in a deck ("Ace",2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,"Jack","Queen" and "King") for every
        suit ("Hearts","Clubs","Diamonds","Spades"), and
        place them in the <code>List</code>. Also, the cards with
        a face value should be <code>Card&lt;String,String&gt;</code>while those
        with a number value should be <code>Card&lt;Integer,String&gt;</code></li>
    <li><code>dealCard</code> returns a random card and removes
        it from the deck. This is <strong>almost exactly</strong> the
        same as the <code>drawOne</code> in the <code>Bag</code> class
        you coded earlier.</li>
    <li><code>size</code> returns the number of cards
        in the deck</li>
</ul>

<h3>DeckIterator</h3>
This is an iterator for a <code>Deck</code> of <code>Card</code>
objects.
<ul>
    <li>Implement the <code>Iterator</code> interface with a generic type E.</li>
    <li>You do not need to override all methods of that interface. Only those
        already overridden in the code.</li>
    <li>The constructor should initialize a <code>Deck</code> variable</li>
    <li>The <code>hasNext</code> method should say <code>true</code> if the
        deck contains more elements (i.e. if the size is greater than zero.). Can you do this in one line?</li>
    <li>The <code>next</code> method returns the next <code>Card</code> in the <code>Deck</code>.
        Now, because of the use of generics, you will have to cast that card to be of type E. Lastly,
        because the Deck deals cards randomly, you can simply deal a card and return it. Can you do this in one line?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deck (second pass)</h3>
In order for the <code>Deck</code> class to be able to use
the iterator (and the for-each loop) (<code>for (Card card:Deck)</code> syntax,
<code>Deck</code> needs to implement <code>Iterable</code>.
<ul>
    <li>Implement <code>Iterable</code> with a generic type <code>Card</code> as you
        will be iterating over <code>Card</code> objects.</li>
    <li>From the methods of <code>Iterable</code> only implement the
        <code>iterator</code> method. This method should return your
        <code>DeckIterator</code>. TIP: You can pas <code>this</code> to
        the constructor of the <code>DeckIterator</code> to
        iterate over the cards in the deck.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task</h3>
Here, you have to complete a few sections.
<ul>
    <li>Complete the enhanced for loop (or for-each) that loops through
        the deck <code>d</code> and prints the cards.</li>
    <li>Complete the method <code>addCards</code>. This should add the value of the
        cards in the <code>ArrayList</code>. Keep in mind that the value of:"Ace" is 1,
        "Jack" is 11, "Queen" is 12, and "King" is 13.</li>
</ul>

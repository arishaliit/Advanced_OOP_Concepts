<p>In this task we have a <code>Bag</code> class.
    This is a virtual "bag" of objects. In a bag, if you
    put fruits, say, three oranges and two apples, when you draw
    an object randomly, you have 3/5 chances of drawing an orange.
</p>
<p>So. this <code>Bag</code> is a kind of storage
    where you put elements, but draw them blindly and
    they are drawn randomly with a certain probability</p>

<p>You can also use a bag to store things you want to
    draw at random, like names, numbers in a raffle,
    or bingo chips when playing Bingo. In this case,
    every object in the bag has the same probability
    of being drawn</p>
<h3>BagException</h3>
<p>Create a class that inherits from <code>Exception</code>
    and to which you can pass a message (<code>String</code>) in the
    constructor. </p>
<p>That's all the direction you get. This is a
    very simple class, and because you are the master
    of inheritance and polymorphism, you do not need
    further directions ;)</p>
<h3>Bag</h3>
<p>In the <code>Bag</code> class you will implement
    the kind of bag we talked about. First, the <code>Bag</code>
    class should specify <strong>one</strong> generic type <code>T</code>.
<ul>
    <li>The constructor for the <code>Bag</code> class
        will take no parameters. It just initializes an
        underlying <code>ArrayList</code> that will hold
        the elements of the <code>Bag</code>'s generic type.</li>
    <li><code>Bag</code> should have a method <code>add</code>
        that takes in an object of the generic type and puts it in
        the <code>ArrayList</code>. Now, <code>Bag</code> does not
        accept <code>null</code> objects, so a <code>null</code>
        is passed, a <code>BagException</code> is thrown with the message
        "Cannot add null to a Bag"</li>
    <li><code>Bag</code> also overloads the <code>add</code>
        method to receive an object of the generic type and
        a number between 0 and 1 which indicates the probability of that element.
        This method will look at
        the number of elements in the <code>Bag</code>
        and insert the new element with the probability
        specified. You need to complete this method.
        If the probability is outside the 0-1 range, a
        <code>BagException</code> should be thrown with a message saying
        that "Probability should be between 0 and 1"</li>
    <li><code>drawOne</code> should get a random index
        between zero and the size of <code>objects</code> and
        return the element at that index.</li>
    <li><code>drawMany</code> should return an <code>ArrayList</code>
        of the generic type. This method takes in one parameter:
        an <code>int</code> that tells the method how many
        times it should draw an element from the <code>Bag</code>.
        This method should draw that number of elements and store them
        in the <code>ArrayList</code> to be returned.</li>

</ul>

<h3>BingoChip</h3>
This class represents a Chip of a Bingo game. Usually
they are comprised of a letter (for the column) and
a number. However, they can be many things. Some games
have a "dummy" chip that goes in the center. That chip
has a letter for the column and some word indicating that
it is the center piece. So, a Bingo chip does not necessarily
have a <code>char</code> and an <code>int</code>. It can have
any kind of two objects... yes. I know, generics.
<ul>
    <li>If you want to know how this class is used, take a look at <code>Task</code>.
        That can come in handy, as this class is purposely lacking in its
        specification. </li>
    <li>This class has two variables of generic types.</li>
    <li>The constructor takes in two parameters to set these two variables.</li>
    <li>This class also overrides the <code>toString</code>
        method to print the chip. It does so by outputting the word
        "Chip:" next to the string representation of the two objects
        separated by a hyphe. For example:Chip:B-12, or Chip:N-Center </li>
</ul>

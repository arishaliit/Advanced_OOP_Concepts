<h1>Resume 2</h1>
<h2>Task 3. Anonymous Inner Classes</h2>

<p>This is almost exactly as Task 2. A lot of the code can be
    copied and pasted in the corresponding files. In fact,
    I recommend you do that.</p>

<p>The <code>Person</code> class is exactly the same as in Task 2. It is safe
    to copy it exactly as is. The <code>Task</code> class is
    also exactly as in Task 2. Copy it into its file. Lastly,
    you can copy the code in the <code>Resume</code> class in pieces. There are very few differences with Task 2. </p>
<p>The differences you have to figure out and change are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <code>List</code> variable to hold the <code>Experience</code> objects
        will be implemented as a <code>PriorityQueue</code>. The idea is that
        no matter the order in which you enter the experiences, they will
        be read from most recent to least recent.</li>
    <li>The constructor should initialize the priority queue with an anonymous <code>Comparator</code> class. The
        <code>compare</code> method should be implemented to return
        a negative value if the second's object end date is bigger than the first objects end date, and a positive value if the second date is
        smaller than the first. You must use the keyword <code>new</code> within the parameter of the constructor of the priority queue.</li>
    <li>Lastly, add a standard getter for experience: <code>getExperience()</code> </li>
</ul>

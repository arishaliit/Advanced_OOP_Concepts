<h1>Resume 3</h1>
<h2>Task 4. Anonymous Inner Classes as Lambdas</h2>

<p>This is almost exactly as Task 3. A lot of the code can be
    copied and pasted in the corresponding files. In fact,
    I recommend you do that.</p>

<p>The <code>Person</code> class is exactly the same as in Task 3. It is safe
    to copy it exactly as is. The <code>Task</code> class is
    also exactly as in Task 3. Copy it into its file. Lastly,
    you can copy the code in the <code>Resume</code> class in pieces. There's only one difference with Task 3. </p>
<ul>
    <li>The constructor should initialize the priority queue with an anonymous <code>Comparator</code> class that works
        exactly as in Task 3, but it must fit in one line <strong>and</strong>
        you must not import the <code>Comparator</code> class in your code.</li>
</ul>
<<div class="hint">
    Use a lambda expression when initializing the priority queue.

<p>Given the class <code>Shape</code>:<p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a constructor for <code>Shape</code> that takes in a <code>String</code>
        as the name of the shape and sets the <code>name</code> variable accordingly.</li>
    <li>Create a class <code>Square</code> that inherits from shape. </li>
    <li>Create a constructor that takes in an <code>double</code>  and a <code>String</code> with the length of the side of the square.
        and the name of the <code>Square</code>, respectively.</li>
    <li>Override the <code>getArea</code> method to return the correct area of a square.</li>
    <li>Override the <code>getPerimeter</code> method to return the perimeter of the square</li>
    <li>Override the <code>equals</code> method to return true
        if the Square being compared has the same side and name as the current <code>Square</code></li>
    <li>Override the <code>toString</code> method to return the name and side of the <code>Square</code> separated by a colon. For example
        if the <code>Square</code>'s name is <code>"room 1"</code> and the side is <code>19</code>, then this
        method should return <code>room 1:19</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This is a long task. Pay attention to the names, spelling and case usage.</p>
The tasks are as follows:
<ul>
    <li>You are given a <code>Person</code> class. Review it</li>
    <li>You are also given the <code>Employable</code> interface. As a side note,
        This interface uses the <code>ArrayList</code> class, which behaves like a List structure.
        There are a cuple of things about it that you will learn as we get further in the course, like
        why does it need to be declared with <code>ArrayList&lt;String&gt;</code></li>
    <li> You are also given the code for the <code>ChildPatient</code> class. This can serve as a reference, perhaps.</li>
    <li> You have to complete the Diagnosable interface.</li>
    <li> You have to then complete the <code>AdultPatient</code> class.
        An AdultPatient is a Person that is both Diagnosticable and Employable. </li>
    <li>After you are done with the classes, finish the implementation of the <code>Task</code> class.</li>

    <li>Once you are done, you can click "Check" and check your work.</li>
</ul>

<h1>A Car Race.</h1>
<p>This task will take you into creating <code>Car</code>s, <code>Racer</code>s
    and then racing the cars.</p>


<h3>Car</h3>
<p>
    This class has four member variables:
<ul>
    <li><code>miles</code>:The number of miles left to travel with the current fuel</li>
    <li><code>odometer</code>: total miles travelled by the car</li>
    <li><code>name</code>: The name (brand) of the car</li>
    <li><code>maxMiles</code>: The maximum number of miles this car can travel when full.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Implement the <code>move</code> method. When this method is called, the
    miles left in the car diminish by the amount passed into the method. The odometer
    adds those miles to its count. If the miles in the car reach zero, the car
    does not move. That is, it does not discount more miles nor add to the odometer.
</p>

<h3>Racer</h3>
<p>This makes a regular car into a racer. That is, a car that can race.... in its own thread</p>
<ul>
    <li>In the class you need to implement the Runnable interface, so that <code>Racer</code> objects can run in a thread</li>
    <li>Create a constructor that takes in a <code>Car</code> object and
        initializes this <code>Racer</code></li>
    <li>Because this class is <code>Runnable</code>, you need to implement one method: <code>run</code>.
        The implementation of <code>run</code> should do the following: As long as the car's odometer
        has not reached the <code>distance</code> this racer is supposed to race,
        the car will move 1 mile. If the car runs out of fuel (i.e. 0 miles left in the tank), the
        car needs to charge before moving. When the car charges, it needs to
        print "Charging" and the current thread should sleep as many milliseconds as
        miles were charged. For example, in <code>Task.java</code> "Kona" will charge for 250 milliseconds, while "Ioniq" will charge for 220.
        This basically simulates a slower re-fueling speed for cars with a bigger range/tank capacity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Here you need to: Set <code>racer1</code> and <code>racer2</code> to be <code>Racer</code> objects with each <code>Car</code> object</p>
<p>You also need to create and start two new <code>Thread</code> objects with the <code>Runnable</code>s.<div class="hint">
    You have to think.... which objects within the main method are "Runnable"?

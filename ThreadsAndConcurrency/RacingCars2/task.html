<h1>A Car Race.</h1>
<p>This task is a slight modification of the previous task.
    You will use <code>Executors</code>.</p>


<h3>Car</h3>
<p>
    This class is exactly the same as the <code>Car</code> in Task 1.
</p>

<h3>Racer</h3>
<p>This has exactly the same implementation as the <code>Racer</code> in task 1.
</p>

<h3>Task</h3>
<ul>
    <li>You need to declare a static member variable called <code>service</code> of type <code>ExecutorService</code></li>
    <li>In <code>main</code>, set <code>racer1</code> and <code>racer2</code> to be <code>Racer</code> objects with each <code>Car</code> object</li>
    <li>
        You also need to create and implement the <code>initExecutorService</code>. This method should
        initialize <code>service</code> creating a new <code>FixedThreadPool</code> with a minimum of 3 threads.
    </li>
    <li>In <code>main</code>, submit both Runnables to the <code>service</code> and then request
        a shutdown of the service. <div class="hint">
            Requesting a shutdown will finish executing the threads in the pool and then stop the pool and finish the program.
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
